# resharper-angularjs

A plugin for ReSharper 9.1 that adds support for AngularJS. 

## What does it do?

This plugin adds the following features:

* Code completion for AngularJS attributes in HTML files. It supports the standard `ng-` syntax, as well as the `data-ng-` and `x-ng-` forms.
* Live Templates for HTML, JavaScript and TypeScript. The templates are grouped into helpers for module, directive, scope, global, html and routing. They can be seen and edited in the Templates Explorer.

The Live Templates are based on the IntelliJ templates by [Pawel Kozlowski](https://github.com/angularjs-livetpls/angularjs-webstorm-livetpls).

## How do I get it?

You can install directly into ReSharper 9.1 via the Extension Manager in the ReSharper menu.

Packages for previous versions (8.2 and 9.0) are still available on the Extension Manager.
