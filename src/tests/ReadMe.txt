You have just generated an empty ReSharper plug-in test project.

To add additional tests to your project, use the Add|New Item... menu.

To add test data to your project, open or create a \test\data folder inside
the solution folder. Then, in each of the tests you create, be sure to override
the RelativeTestDataPath property to correctly point ReSharper to your tests.
